# Ship Security Optimization with Obstacle Detection System

## Overview

This project, focused on ship security optimization, involves the development of a pattern recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the YOLOv3 method. The system is trained on a dataset of 4303 images to perform object detection, identifying obstacles such as red balls, green balls, and mangroves. The primary objective is to enhance decision-making for ship movement by providing real-time obstacle detection.

## Features

- Object detection for obstacles (red balls, green balls, mangroves, red tower, and green tower) these objects represents obctacle on the sea.
- Utilizes CNN and YOLOv3 for accurate detection.
- Trained on a dataset of 4303 images.
- Enhances decision-making for ship movement.

## Datasets

The dataset used for training the system is not included in this repository due to its size. You can obtain the dataset from [provide link or instructions on where to acquire the dataset].

## Files

This repository includes the following files:

- `Obstacle_Detection_System.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for training and testing the model.
- `pretrained_models/`: Directory containing pre-trained models.
